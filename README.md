# Csh_mergeSort
The process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

## Why
1. Merge sort is a popular type of sorting algorithm because it can be implemented relatively easily and is demonstrates good time complexity (O log n)

## Functional Requirements
1. Must take a list of lists of integers as an input parameter
